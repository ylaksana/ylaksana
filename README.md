Hello there, I'm Yohannes! I'm currently a computer science graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin and I like creating mobile apps! I've made mobile apps for sales tracking and social interaction and it's a field that I'm passionate about because I love creating apps that can solve every day problems. I also enjoy AI and how it can integrate into existing apps to further assist its users. I've taken many classes in AI and machine learning in my Masters program and I see how it could be revolutionary in many fields, even in software development. I'm interested in looking for opportunities in the tech industry and would love to talk about my skills and just tech in general.

    </summary>
    This is a sales tracking app that I've developed by learning a new tech stack consisting of React Native, Expo, and Typescript. I made it this year because I wanted to help my wife with her art business sales. I thought it was tedious to write down sales on a notepad and thought it'd be cool if I could create an app like Square that could immediately log sales information into a organized list. Each market event we attend has a different audience and I thought it'd be nice to see specifically what each audience like which products. I'm planning on developing it further by keeping track of inventory as well as trying out an AI to analyze sales.

    </summary>
    This is an android app I developed with another software engineer called SwipeMeet. It is a social event application where users are able to post events they're interested in and interact with other users. The app integrates Firebase for backend services and Firechat for real-time messaging through chat rooms. Users can swipe on event postings left or right to show interest and utilize a filtering system to narrow down events. Many of the functions are made to facilitate an engaging social environment where people can easily find events that they're interested in and meet other people with similar interests.

    </summary>
    These are class projects that involved designing and optimizing neural networks. These networks utilize the PyTorch library in Python and they deal with challenges such as objection detection and computer vision using batched images. I also did state based learning for SuperTuxKart hockey matches and developed a network policy that was suitable for scoring goals.

    </summary>
    This is a discord bot that pulls information about a specific Pokemon from an external API. It can display various attributes of a given Pokemon such as its ID, name, moves, stats, etc.
    This bot also manages a PostgreSQL database that allows users to create and battle Pokemon. User input can be made to create a Pokemon instance as an entry in the database with its own unique ID, abilities, and battle stats. Additionally, users can make inputs that can manipulate Pokemon instances that belong to them and interact with other users' Pokemon instances through battles.<br>
</p>

Here is an example of what it can do so far:

    </summary>
    This project is a text-based RPG adventure game where the player uses a team of cat warriors to explore the world and fight enemy pets. This was my first project that I've done in C++ and my first video game project. I wanted to try making a video game with the skills I learned in my coding classes and the work was fulfilling as I had freedom in creativity, designing the game from scratch such as classes, enemies, attacks, and functions for interactions.

    This is a website project I started during Winter 2023 and I'm currently working on it. I learned HTML and CSS and decided to create something to build experience and intuition on website creation. I'm still figuring out features that viewers can interact with rather than just displaying static information for more user engagement.

Here are some games that I've developed in the past as a 3D artist and animator: <br>

    <a href="https://aisle2.itch.io/custodial-conundrum"><u>Custodial Conundrum</u></a> - A stealth/puzzle game where you play as a janitor wielding magic.
    </summary>
    This is a stealth/puzzle game that I developed in my senior year of university with 6 other game developers. This was an enjoyable project to be a part of. I had fun creating comedic animations and character models for this game. 
    We felt like janitors don't get enough appreciation for their work, so we decided that the player character would be an undervalued janitor working for a magical school of wizards and witches. The premise of this game is that the janitor would
    sneak through the school, steal various spells to gain power, and use them on the student body that undermined him.<br>

    <a href="https://simmer.io/@EdwinSilerio/back-to-class"><u>Back to Class</u></a> - A text-based simulator game where you play as an elementary school teacher. 
    </summary>
    This is a simulator game I developed during an internship with 6 other game developers. The game was interesting to work on as we had only 3 months of development time to
    complete the game so we had to use our time wisely. For this project, I worked on the character models and their animations. This game was meant for elementary and middle school teachers to test their knowledge on what to do in various situations
    with students such as rule-breaking and bullying. <br>
