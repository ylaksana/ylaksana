Hello there, I'm Yohannes! Welcome to my info page! To tell a little bit about myself, I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with the bachelor's degree in Neuroscience and now starting to dive into computer programming. I'm currently a sophomore taking introductory computer science courses at the University of Houston. I'm new to the field and looking for new opportunities and experiences in the workplace. I want to broaden my horizons and know more about the tech industry outside of the classroom. I'm planning on making projects and adding them to this page in the future. Currently, I'm interested in learning software and game development, but open to discovering other fields such as cybersecurity.

        <a href="https://github.com/ylaksana/pokemonCaller"><u>Pokemon Caller</u></a> - Pokemon Information Discord Bot 
    </summary>
    This is a discord bot that pulls information about a specific Pokemon from an external API. It can display various attributes of a given Pokemon such as its ID, name, moves, stats, etc.
This project is in the early stages of development, but my final goal is to create a database that is able to store multiple Pokemon entries that can be changed by external inputs and simulate Pokemon battles.
