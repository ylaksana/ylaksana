I'm Yohannes! I'm currently studying computer science at the University of Houston! I'm new to the field and looking for new opportunities and experiences in the workplace. I want to broaden my horizons and know more about the tech industry outside of the classroom. I'm planning on making projects and adding them to this page. Currently, I'm interested in learning software and website development, but open to discovering other fields such as cybersecurity.
