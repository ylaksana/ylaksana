Hello there, I'm Yohannes! Welcome to my info page! To tell a little bit about myself, I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with the bachelor's degree in Neuroscience and now starting to dive into computer programming. I'm currently a sophomore taking introductory computer science courses at the University of Houston. I'm new to the field and looking for new opportunities and experiences in the workplace. I want to broaden my horizons and know more about the tech industry outside of the classroom. I'm planning on making projects and adding them to this page in the future. Currently, I'm interested in learning software and game development, but open to discovering other fields such as cybersecurity.
